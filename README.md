# Kai Landing Page

This repository contains the code for **Kai**, an AI‑powered travel planning companion. The landing page introduces visitors to the concept of bespoke travel experiences curated by Kai.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main landing page showing an overview of Kai and how it works
- `styles.css` – Styling for the site
- `script.js` – Placeholder for future JavaScript enhancements
- `assets/` – Contains the `demo.mp4` video used on the page
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the site automatically to GitHub Pages

## How to Use

1. Replace `assets/demo.mp4` with your own promotional video if desired. Keep the filename the same so it plugs into the page automatically.
2. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will handle the deployment.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings under **Settings → Pages** and select **GitHub Actions** as the source.

After deployment, your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
